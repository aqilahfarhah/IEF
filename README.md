Purpose our ai model: To predict date and place for future flood in Malaysia. We know that some common place like Kelantan used to have flood every year. But how about the place that we didn't expect? How can we expect that Selangor can get flood? So, we implement this model to see the trend in each state of Malaysia

Constraint: We cannot find the latest dataset so we use 2000-2010 dataset :( and try to compare the result (prediction) in the latest year. In addition, we might need more time to make sure our model can achieve high accuracy if getting chance
