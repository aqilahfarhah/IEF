AI Model Purpose: To predict dates and places for the future occurances of  floods in Malaysia. As we know, some common places, such as Kelantan state in Malaysia, used to have flood events every year. But, how about the other places that we didn't expect flood events to be occurred? Question in mind such as; when we will expect that Selangor can get flood? So, we implement this model to see the trend in each state of Malaysia, to predict and analyze the occurance of flood events.

Mode Constraint: We cannot find the latest dataset, so we use 2000-2010 dataset, and try to compare the results (prediction) in the latest years. In addition, if been given the oppurtunity and more time, we will make sure our model can achieve the outmost accuracy.
